# Ledger Service

`apps/ledger` consumes `wallet.events` and writes an immutable accounting
trail. Wallet events are the source of balance mutations.

Run:

```sh
cargo run -p ledger
```

The wallet remains the hot-path balance owner. It owns deposits, withdrawals,
balances, locked funds, and reservations. When engine events move money, wallet
applies the resulting account deltas, releases, fees, funding payments, and
liquidation or ADL settlements, then emits wallet events for ledger to record.

Engine events are audit context only for ledger. They may be referenced from
wallet events, but they are not accounting facts on their own. Wallet and engine
replies are request lifecycle messages and must not create ledger entries.

Ledger v1 does not replace wallet writes; it mirrors wallet events into:

- `ledger_events`: one journal row per consumed stream record.
- `ledger_entries`: normalized balance deltas derived from each event.
- `ledger_offsets`: consumed Redpanda offsets.

Entry mapping:

| Wallet event | Ledger entries |
| --- | --- |
| `DepositApplied` | `DEPOSIT`: `total_delta=+amount`, `locked_delta=0` |
| `WithdrawalApplied` | `WITHDRAWAL`: `total_delta=-amount`, `locked_delta=0` |
| `FundsReserved` | `RESERVE`: `total_delta=0`, `locked_delta=+amount` |
| `FundsReleased` | `RELEASE`: `total_delta=0`, `locked_delta=-amount` |
| `TradeSettled` | `TRADE_DEBIT`: `total_delta=-debit_amount`, `locked_delta=-debit_amount`; `TRADE_CREDIT`: `total_delta=+credit_amount`, `locked_delta=0` |
| Funding, fee, liquidation, ADL, or insurance wallet settlement events | Balance deltas exactly as emitted by wallet |

Ledger starts from stored offsets, or earliest offsets when no offset is stored.
