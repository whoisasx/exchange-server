# Engine Stream Contract

This contract describes the current Rust wire protocol used by this workspace and the intended agreement with the external C++ matching engine.

The Rust protocol uses `engine.input` for engine-affecting inputs. `ENGINE_COMMANDS_TOPIC` remains an alias for `ENGINE_INPUT_TOPIC`, and `ENGINE_COMMANDS_LEGACY_TOPIC` names the old `engine.commands` topic for compatibility.

Documentation is flattened under `docs/`. JSON examples and protocol fixtures live under `docs/examples/`.

The Rust source of truth is:

- `crates/protocol/src/common.rs`
- `crates/protocol/src/engine.rs`
- `crates/protocol/src/wallet.rs`

All stream messages are JSON encoded with this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "VariantName",
  "payload": {}
}
```

## Topics

| Topic | Producer | Consumer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `engine.input` | wallet outbox relay | C++ engine | Globally ordered engine-affecting inputs for orders, cancels, mark price, and funding. |
| `engine.replies` | C++ engine | server reply consumer | Request lifecycle replies only. |
| `engine.events` | C++ engine | wallet, projector, websocket, timeseries | Durable engine facts and state changes. |

Wallet and `engine-ingress` enqueue engine-affecting inputs into
`wallet_outbox`; the wallet outbox relay is the only Redpanda publisher for
`engine.input`. Wallet owns the hot-path reservation flow for orders and
cancels. `engine-ingress` owns pass-through mark price and funding inputs.

## Topic Provisioning

Provisioning must not rely on broker defaults for `engine.input`. Local, e2e, and production topic creation must create it with one partition and 30-minute time retention:

```sh
rpk topic create --if-not-exists --partitions 1 -c retention.ms=1800000 engine.input
rpk topic alter-config engine.input --set retention.ms=1800000
```

The single partition is part of the engine recovery contract: every engine-affecting input must share one ordered Redpanda log. The 30-minute `retention.ms` setting matches the MVP recovery window in the engine plan.

## Ordering

| Topic | Record key | Ordering rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine.input` | none required for MVP; payload carries `market_id` | Single ordered input log. The engine dispatcher reads in offset order, then routes each input to the owning market thread. |
| `engine.replies` | `request_id` | Engine must publish to `payload.envelope.reply_partition` from the original request input. |
| `engine.events` | `market_id` as string | Engine should keep events for one market ordered on the same partition. |

All engine-affecting inputs enter the single ordered `engine.input` log. Mark price and funding are first-class inputs in that log; they are not embedded into user order commands. This gives recovery one input offset while still allowing the engine to dispatch work to per-market threads internally.

For every `market_id`, the engine must emit a strictly increasing `engine_sequence` on every event for that market. Redpanda offsets are still used by consumers for replay progress, but consumers should use `(market_id, engine_sequence)` for market ordering. Global ordering across markets is not guaranteed.

Engine events must be self-routeable by payload. WebSocket consumers must not need database lookups to identify the affected account or market.

## Common Types

Enums are serialized as exact uppercase strings:

```text
Asset: USDC, USDT, SOL, ETH, BTC, PERP, HYP
Side: LONG, SHORT
OrderType: LIMIT, MARKET
ExecutionReason: TRADE, LIQUIDATION
```

Numeric IDs, sequence, timestamp, price, quantity, amount, and margin fields are integer values compatible with signed 64-bit integers unless a field is explicitly defined as a string ID.

Margin is isolated only in the MVP. Engine risk state is scoped by `user_id + market_id`; cross-margin and cross-market liquidation are outside this contract.

`CommandEnvelope` is carried from server to wallet to engine for request-originated inputs:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_01HZ8YEXAMPLE",
  "idempotency_key": "client-order-1",
  "user_id": 42,
  "reply_partition": 0
}
```

The engine must copy `request_id` into request lifecycle replies so the server can resolve the original request. Durable side effects must be represented by events, not replies.

## Engine Inputs

Engine inputs go to `engine.input` and are ordered by the final engine input log.

Current Rust `EngineInput` variants:

- `PlaceOrder`
- `CancelOrder`
- `LiquidatePosition`
- `MarkPriceUpdated`
- `FundingRateUpdated`
- `FundingSettlementTick`

Later input variants may include `AddIsolatedMargin`, `RemoveIsolatedMargin`, `RiskConfigUpdated`, `MarketConfigUpdated`, and trusted keeper hints such as `EvaluateLiquidation`.

`LiquidatePosition` is a compatibility request path. In the target flow, liquidation is engine-owned. Any external liquidation input should be treated as a trusted evaluation hint; the engine must recalculate eligibility, quantity, and execution path from current engine state.

Input example locations under `docs/examples`:

| Input | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| `PlaceOrder` | `docs/examples/engine-place-order.command.json` |
| `PlaceOrder` reduce-only | `docs/examples/engine-place-order-reduce-only.command.json` |
| `CancelOrder` | `docs/examples/engine-cancel-order.command.json` |
| `MarkPriceUpdated` | `docs/examples/engine-mark-price-updated.input.json` |
| `FundingRateUpdated` | `docs/examples/engine-funding-rate-updated.input.json` |
| `FundingSettlementTick` | `docs/examples/engine-funding-settlement-tick.input.json` |
| `LiquidatePosition` compatibility hint | `docs/examples/engine-liquidate-position.command.json` |

### PlaceOrder

Routing field: `market_id`

Fixtures:

- `docs/examples/engine-place-order.command.json`
- `docs/examples/engine-place-order-reduce-only.command.json`

Payload fields:

```text
input_id, envelope, reservation_id, market_id, market_name, side, order_type, quantity, price, reduce_only, margin_asset, reserved_margin_amount, leverage
```

`input_id` is optional. `margin_asset`, `reserved_margin_amount`, and `leverage` are first-class fields in the current Rust protocol and have defaults only for backward-compatible deserialization of older JSON.

Required engine behavior:

- Validate and accept or reject the order using current orderbook, position, mark price, fee, and isolated margin state.
- Treat `reduce_only=true` as a hard constraint: the order must not increase or reverse the user's isolated position.
- Publish exactly one `OrderAccepted` or `OrderRejected` reply for the request.
- If the order rests on the book, publish `OrderOpened`.
- If the order matches, publish `TradeExecuted`.
- Expire any reduce-only unmatched remainder that would create exposure; do not publish `OrderOpened` for that remainder.

The server may validate close quantity against projector state, but the engine owns final reduce-only enforcement because it has current matching and position state.

### CancelOrder

Routing field: `market_id`

Fixture: `docs/examples/engine-cancel-order.command.json`

Required engine behavior:

- Publish exactly one `CancelAccepted` or `CancelRejected` reply for the request.
- If cancellation releases reserved funds, publish a durable engine event such as `OrderCancelled` or `ReservationReleased`.

### MarkPriceUpdated

Routing field: `market_id`

Mark price is a separate ordered risk input, not a field attached to every user order.

Payload fields:

```text
input_id, market_id, mark_price, index_price, source_timestamp_ms, published_at_ms, valid_until_ms, source_sequence, source_status
```

`input_id` is optional.

Required engine behavior:

- Store the latest valid mark and index price for the market.
- Run liquidation checks for the affected market after applying the mark.
- If the mark is stale, reject risk-increasing orders and allow reduce-only and cancel actions.

### FundingRateUpdated

Routing field: `market_id`

Funding rate is a separate ordered input sent on the funding cadence. The engine stores the latest funding rate and interval in market and checkpoint state.

Payload fields:

```text
input_id, market_id, funding_interval_id, rate, rate_scale, interval_start_ms, interval_end_ms, source_timestamp_ms
```

`input_id` is optional.

### FundingSettlementTick

Routing field: `market_id`

Funding settlement is explicit. A rate update tells the engine the current rate; a settlement tick tells it to apply funding for an interval.

Payload fields:

```text
input_id, market_id, funding_interval_id, settle_at_ms
```

`input_id` is optional.

Required engine behavior:

- Apply funding to open isolated positions for the market.
- Emit durable events for account deltas, funding payments, and any resulting risk state changes.
- Run liquidation checks for the affected market after settlement.

## Liquidation Contract

Liquidation eligibility is engine-owned state. Rust read models may show indicative risk, but they are not authoritative.

The liquidation loop must run after:

- every executed trade
- every `MarkPriceUpdated`
- every `FundingSettlementTick`
- startup restore after replay catches up

Liquidation is market-local for MVP isolated margin. The engine uses the latest mark/index price, isolated position state, margin state, and available execution path. Liquidation execution must be reduce-only for the liquidated account and must not increase or reverse exposure.

Liquidation side effects are events, not request replies. A liquidation execution should emit `TradeExecuted` with `execution_reason="LIQUIDATION"` plus the relevant liquidation, fee, position, risk, and account-delta events.

If the compatibility `LiquidatePosition` request path remains enabled, `LiquidationAccepted` and `LiquidationRejected` are lifecycle replies for that request only. They are not durable liquidation facts.

## Replies

Replies go to `engine.replies` and must be produced to the original request envelope's `reply_partition`.

Replies are request lifecycle messages only. They unblock HTTP or RPC callers; they are not durable accounting facts and must not be used as the source of truth for fills, balances, funding, liquidation, or orderbook state.

| Reply | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| `OrderAccepted` | `docs/examples/engine-order-accepted.reply.json` |
| `OrderRejected` | `docs/examples/engine-order-rejected.reply.json` |
| `CancelAccepted` | `docs/examples/engine-cancel-accepted.reply.json` |
| `CancelRejected` | `docs/examples/engine-cancel-rejected.reply.json` |
| `LiquidationAccepted` | `docs/examples/engine-liquidation-accepted.reply.json` |
| `LiquidationRejected` | `docs/examples/engine-liquidation-rejected.reply.json` |

Reply variants include `request_id`. `source_input_id` and `source_input_offset` are optional audit fields when available.

```text
OrderAccepted: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, order_id, reservation_id
OrderRejected: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, reservation_id, reason
CancelAccepted: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, order_id
CancelRejected: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, order_id, reason
LiquidationAccepted: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, liquidation_id, order_id
LiquidationRejected: request_id, source_input_id, source_input_offset, liquidation_id, reason
```

`OrderRejected.reservation_id` may be `null` if no reservation should be released by downstream consumers.

Mark price, funding, startup liquidation, and engine-originated liquidation flows do not produce request lifecycle replies.

## Events

Events go to `engine.events`. Events are market-scoped and should be keyed by `market_id`.

Market-scoped engine event payloads carry idempotent event metadata:

```text
engine_event_id: stable unique event ID when available
market_id: market affected by the event
engine_sequence: strictly increasing per market_id
engine_timestamp_ms: Unix epoch milliseconds assigned by the engine
source_input_id and source_input_offset: optional source engine input identity for replay/audit
```

Producers should set `engine_event_id` and keep it stable across retries of the same emitted event. Consumers use it to deduplicate exact event delivery when present. Consumers use `(market_id, engine_sequence)` for market ordering and gap detection. For ordering, consumers should trust `engine_sequence` before `engine_timestamp_ms`; timestamps are for bucketing, display, and latency analysis.

Event fixture locations under `docs/examples`:

| Event | Fixture |
| --- | --- |
| `OrderOpened` | `docs/examples/engine-order-opened.event.json` |
| `OrderCancelled` | `docs/examples/engine-order-cancelled.event.json` |
| `OrderExpired` | `docs/examples/engine-order-expired.event.json` |
| `ReservationReleased` | `docs/examples/engine-reservation-released.event.json` |
| `TradeExecuted` | `docs/examples/engine-trade-executed.event.json` |
| `TradeExecuted` with `execution_reason="LIQUIDATION"` | `docs/examples/engine-trade-executed-liquidation.event.json` |
| `OrderBookDelta` | `docs/examples/engine-orderbook-delta.event.json` |
| `MarkPriceUpdated` | `docs/examples/engine-mark-price-updated.event.json` |
| `FundingRateUpdated` | `docs/examples/engine-funding-rate-updated.event.json` |
| `FundingPaymentApplied` | `docs/examples/engine-funding-payment-applied.event.json` |
| `PositionChanged` | `docs/examples/engine-position-changed.event.json` |
| `RiskStateUpdated` | `docs/examples/engine-risk-state-updated.event.json` |
| `LiquidationStarted` | `docs/examples/engine-liquidation-started.event.json` |
| `LiquidationExecuted` | `docs/examples/engine-liquidation-executed.event.json` |
| `LiquidationCompleted` | `docs/examples/engine-liquidation-completed.event.json` |
| `AdlExecuted` | `docs/examples/engine-adl-executed.event.json` |
| `AccountDelta` | `docs/examples/engine-account-delta.event.json` |

Current Rust protocol tests validate all JSON fixtures in `docs/examples` against `EngineInput`, `EngineReply`, or `EngineEvent`.

Consumers route market-scoped events with `market_id` and account fields such as `user_id`, `maker_user_id`, `taker_user_id`, `payments[].user_id`, or other variant-specific account identifiers.

Event consumers use engine events as follows:

- Wallet consumes money-moving engine events such as reservation release, trade settlement, funding payment, liquidation settlement, insurance fund transfer, ADL settlement, and account delta.
- Projector consumes engine events to update orders, fills, positions, orderbook, risk state, funding history, and mark price history.
- WebSocket consumes engine and wallet events for live user and market updates.
- Ledger consumes `wallet.events` as the accounting source. Engine events may be audit context, but they are not the balance-mutation source of truth.
- Timeseries consumes `TradeExecuted` for candles and trade history using `engine_timestamp_ms` for buckets and `(market_id, engine_sequence)` for idempotency.

`TradeExecuted.settlements` is the wallet-facing settlement instruction. Each settlement becomes a wallet settlement command. Liquidation trades may omit settlements for synthetic liquidation order IDs unless those IDs correspond to wallet reservations.

`OrderBookDelta` is price-level based. `bids` are LONG-side levels, `asks` are SHORT-side levels, and `quantity=0` means delete that price level.

Orderbook snapshots and deltas use the same per-market sequence. A snapshot carries the latest applied `engine_sequence`. Clients that need a gap-free orderbook should connect to websocket first, subscribe to the market, buffer live `OrderBookDelta` messages, then fetch the REST snapshot. After the snapshot is loaded, discard buffered deltas with `engine_sequence <= snapshot.engine_sequence` and apply only greater sequences.

## Compatibility Rules

- Do not rename JSON fields without updating Rust protocol tests and fixtures.
- Do not change enum casing.
- Always include the top-level `type` and `payload` fields.
- Unknown extra fields are ignored by Rust serde today, but the engine should not rely on that for required behavior.
- New optional fields should be added in a backward-compatible way.
- Required field changes should be treated as a protocol version change.

## Fixture Validation

The protocol crate has tests that deserialize every fixture in `docs/examples`.

Run:

```sh
cargo test -p protocol
```
